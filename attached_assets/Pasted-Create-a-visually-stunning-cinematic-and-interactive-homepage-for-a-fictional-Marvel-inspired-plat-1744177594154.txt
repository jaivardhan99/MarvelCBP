Create a visually stunning, cinematic, and interactive homepage for a fictional Marvel-inspired platform titled "Chronoverse".

üéØ Objective:
Design an immersive landing experience that showcases four major Marvel characters:

Iron Man

Spider-Man

Dr. Doom

Knull

These characters should be laid out horizontally, side-by-side, each occupying 25% width of the viewport. The homepage must be highly interactive, featuring 3D models, animated borders, looping videos or GIFs, hover effects, and buttery-smooth transitions.

üß† Key Requirements
1. üé® Theme & Visual Style
Embrace a Marvel Universe aesthetic with a dark cosmic theme.

Use a bold, cinematic color palette:

Deep black

Glowing red

Metallic gold

Cosmic purple

Emerald green

UI/UX styling must include:

Bold fonts

Holographic/glitch effects

Tech-style buttons

Layered environments for depth

Optional: Add ambient sound or background music per character (with on/off toggle).

Place a Chronoverse logo at the top center, animated with a Marvel-style reveal effect (e.g., glowing pulse, cosmic energy flare).

2. üß± Layout & Design Concept
Fullscreen layout with no scroll required initially.

Divide the screen into four horizontal sections (each 25% width).

Each section features:

One of the four characters

A 3D model, GIF, or looping video

Animated glowing borders matching the character‚Äôs theme

The character‚Äôs name in large, stylized, animated typography

3. ü¶∏ Character Presentation
For each of the four character blocks:

Use glTF/GLB 3D models or high-quality WebM/GIF videos.

Integrate interactive or autoplay animations:

Iron Man: Suit-up animation or Arc Reactor pulse

Spider-Man: Swinging or wall crawling

Dr. Doom: Spell casting or shield summon

Knull: Symbiote tendrils or darkness wave

Animate character names with styles such as:

Slide-in

Glitch effect

Glowing letters

Flame burst

4. üåÄ Animation & Interactivity
Use hardware-accelerated, buttery smooth transitions.

Leverage animation libraries: GSAP, Framer Motion, Three.js, or Lottie.

Hover Effects per character section:

Parallax tilt or subtle zoom

Themed aura/particle burst (e.g., sparks, webs, energy)

Text or name glow animations

Click Effects (optional for future scope):

Expand section into a fullscreen cinematic modal with character lore or gallery

5. üì± Responsiveness
Desktop: Four characters in a single horizontal line

Tablet: Two rows, two characters per row

Mobile (optional): Single-column layout with vertical scroll; preserve animations and responsiveness

6. ‚öôÔ∏è Performance & Optimization
Use lazy-loading for all 3D models and videos

Optimize assets: WebM, WebP, glTF for reduced load time

Implement GPU-accelerated animations and smooth transitions

Add fallback static images for older/unsupported devices

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Suggestions
Frontend:

React / Next.js (preferred)

Or Vanilla HTML5 + CSS + JavaScript

Use standard CSS or Bootstrap for layout when needed

3D Model & Rendering:

Three.js

react-three-fiber

<model-viewer> for easy 3D embeds

Animations:

GSAP

Framer Motion

Lottie for micro-animations

Assets:

Use glTF/GLB for 3D models

WebM for looping videos

WebP / GIF as visual backups

Design System:

Tailwind CSS (preferred for utility-first styling)

Or styled-components for scoped component styles
